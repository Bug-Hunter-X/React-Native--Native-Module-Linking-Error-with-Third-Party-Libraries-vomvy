This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky bug in React Native involving native module linking issues with third-party libraries. The problem often arises from inconsistencies between the library's native module requirements and the project's configuration.  The `RN_NativeModuleError.js` file shows the problematic code, while `RN_NativeModuleSolution.js` provides a corrected version with explanations of the fixes.
