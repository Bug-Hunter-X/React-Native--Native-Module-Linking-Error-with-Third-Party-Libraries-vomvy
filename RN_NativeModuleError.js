This error occurs when using a third-party library that depends on a native module and that native module is not properly linked or configured in your React Native project. This can happen if you've recently updated the library, updated your React Native version, or if you're using a library that isn't fully compatible with your project setup.  The error might manifest in various ways, often with vague messages like 'Native module cannot be found' or 'undefined is not an object (evaluating '...native module call...')'
