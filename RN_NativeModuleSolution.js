The solution typically involves verifying and fixing native module links.  This might involve:

1. **Cleaning and rebuilding:** Run `yarn clean` or `npm run clean`, followed by rebuilding the project (often `yarn android` or `npx react-native run-android` for Android, and similar commands for iOS).
2. **Checking package linking:**  Ensure the third-party library's native module is correctly linked within your project.  Some libraries require manual linking steps (check the library's documentation).  For autolinking (modern approach), ensure that your project's build settings are up-to-date.
3. **Autolinking configuration:** Verify that autolinking is enabled (the default) and that the necessary dependencies are correctly installed. In some cases, you might need to explicitly configure autolinking for the specific platform (Android or iOS). If autolinking fails to work, then manual linking might be necessary
4. **Native module installation:** Make sure the native modules are correctly installed for both Android and IOS.
5. **Verifying platform compatibility:** Confirm that the library is compatible with your current React Native version and the Android/iOS platform versions. 
6. **Inspecting the library's instructions:** Carefully review the library's documentation and installation instructions for platform-specific steps or potential issues. 

The `RN_NativeModuleSolution.js` file showcases how these steps might be integrated into a project.
